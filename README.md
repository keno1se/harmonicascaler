If doing a serach for harmonicascaler on google  
It shows the original hsPWA - harmonicascaler PWA  
I don't want that at this point  
Instead I use the minimal Jekyll theme to direct towards Google play  
where the harmonicascaler APP can be found and downloaded. 
To do this see the below present setup


# present setup  
1. ***gh-pages/_layouts/default.html*** -controlles this page  
2. ***config.yml** - over ride default.html standard settings  
3. ***index.md*** - empty but needed to render  

# To render hsPWA - harmonicascaler  
Remover First_ from this  
First_index.html  
and leave it just to this:  
index.html  
The first hsPWA will spring to life.  

# bbb_index_html  
Is just a test file, can be deleted, keept for reference
